Having foolishly forgoten to save each script for the levels when i completed them, levels 1-5 were done on a different
character than levels 6-9. 
Tim Allen has all the scirpts in his folder, but keep in mind 1-5 are from another character, so they may be a little different
Tim Allen Can complete epic mode
